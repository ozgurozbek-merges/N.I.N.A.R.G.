I think that License should be enough. It has the same status as "Unlicensed" or
"No-License" software, but, with the addition of reproducing the code or re-compiling
it WITHOUT being able to distribute it as a new product. That is to allow all modders
and mods a happy time.

Whatever they do with their mods are up to them.

We should add some sort of pre-defined fields that parse JSONs for easier data creation.
