# Holy Amendments

## Design Specifications

### Art Style

* 3D
* Overwatch-y

#### Need Concept art for

* Dungeon interior, also can be used as the starting grounds for webpage. Top parts and the center could be a little empty. IDK.

### Platform

* PC
* Steam integration for 3.5 things
    - Steam Username
    - Stats
    - Online Market
    - "Hey man I'm playing this game haha check it out it's got a funny name i guess"
* Some server for Mirror Market OR Use steam servers for it, IDK how

### Game Style

* Immersive Sim-Like, multiple solutions for multiple problems. Helps with NPCs & environment. 
    - Definitely needs to put out fire with water.
    - Definitely.
    - It is a must you don't understand.
* Fantasy Setting, derived from my D&D Campaign. Less work.
* FPS Shooter

## To Be Done

* Roguelike dungeon spawner
* Lots of room designs
* Random Spawner Script, for items & pickups. Derives rarity multiplication from room level
* Weapon Scripts
    - Burst
    - Swing
    - Casting
* Player air controller (Mercy ULT in OW)
* GitHUB WENV
* Cool looking shader
* Even cooler post processing
* Even cooler script that understands that you are in a combo and then, MAKES THINGS RED AND ZOOMS IN SLIGHTLY!!
* Fun patchnotes for common-folk to understand. Not everybody is a nerd. Duh.
* AoE Effects script
* Aoe Detection scripts (which seems to be integrated somewhere in monster detection but I'm probably blind)
* Watch more half-life myths debunking videos, take notes may-beh.
* A static website & domain thing for patchnotes and whatnot that renders markdown because I'm lazy.

## Done

* Weapons refill via energy, no bullets & etc.
* Player Controller
* Pickups script
* Weapon scripts
    - Dart or Bow
    - Shotgun
    - Normal
* Ring of Levitation -> For air control, basically a jetpack (NO RING MODEL or PICKUP)

## Game Specifications

### Items

Gotta make it standarialized. Coloring and effects should follow this:

* Common = No Outline or Emission
* Rare = Blue
* Epic = Purple
* Legendary = Orange
* World Item = Red
* Pickups = White

### Gameplay

* Dynamic difficulties for each run. No-market, 1HP, Double all damage...

Main loop:

1. Enter the dungeon.
2. Scavenge the level & Kill all enemies.
3. Teleport to new level.
4. Enter boss level & Kill the boss.
5. Presented with a choice to exit the dungeon or continue. Continue repeats 1 to 5.
6. If exited, sell items for money and use money to buy items or perma upgrade your character with an ancient crystal.
7. Re-enter the dungeon.
