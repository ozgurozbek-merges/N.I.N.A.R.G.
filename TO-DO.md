# To-Do

## To Be Done

* Colour blind enemy and friendly outlines. Make them in the shader.
* Randomized Color Correction for every room so even the same rooms back to back look different. Outlines should NEVER change.
* Roguelike dungeon spawner
    - Lots of room designs
* Random Spawner Script, for items & pickups. Derives rarity multiplication from room level
* Weapon Scripts
    - Burst
    - Swing
    - Casting
    - Dart or Bow
    - Shotgun
    - Normal
* Player air controller (Mercy ULT in OW)
* Even cooler script that understands that you are in a combo and then, MAKES THINGS RED AND ZOOMS IN SLIGHTLY!!
* Fun patchnotes for common-folk to understand. Not everybody is a nerd. Duh.
* Detection scripts (which seems to be integrated somewhere in monster detection but I'm probably blind)
* A static website & domain thing for patchnotes and whatnot that renders markdown because I'm lazy.
* Weapons refill via energy, no bullets & etc.
* Pickups script
* Ring of Levitation -> For air control, basically a jetpack (NO RING MODEL or PICKUP)

## Done

* Player Controller
* Cool looking shader
* Even cooler post processing
* AoE Effects script
* GitHUB WENV
