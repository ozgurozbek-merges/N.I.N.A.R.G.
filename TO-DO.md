# To-Do

## To Be Done

* Color Correction randomized for every room.
* Roguelike dungeon spawner
* Lots of room designs
* Random Spawner Script, for items & pickups. Derives rarity multiplication from room level
* Weapon Scripts
    - Burst
    - Swing
    - Casting
* Player air controller (Mercy ULT in OW)
* GitHUB WENV
* Cool looking shader
* Even cooler post processing
* Even cooler script that understands that you are in a combo and then, MAKES THINGS RED AND ZOOMS IN SLIGHTLY!!
* Fun patchnotes for common-folk to understand. Not everybody is a nerd. Duh.
* AoE Effects script
* Aoe Detection scripts (which seems to be integrated somewhere in monster detection but I'm probably blind)
* Watch more half-life myths debunking videos, take notes may-beh.
* A static website & domain thing for patchnotes and whatnot that renders markdown because I'm lazy.

## Done

* Weapons refill via energy, no bullets & etc.
* Player Controller
* Pickups script
* Weapon scripts
    - Dart or Bow
    - Shotgun
    - Normal
* Ring of Levitation -> For air control, basically a jetpack (NO RING MODEL or PICKUP)
